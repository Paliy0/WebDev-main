        <h3>Solar Panels</h3>
        <p>A solar panel works by allowing photons, or particles of light, to knock electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. Solar panels actually comprise many, smaller units called photovoltaic cells. (Photovoltaic simply means they convert sunlight into electricity.) Many cells linked together make up a solar panel.
        To work, photovoltaic cells need to establish an electric field. Much like a magnetic field, which occurs due to opposite poles, an electric field occurs when opposite charges are separated. To get this field, manufacturers "dope" silicon with other materials, giving each slice of the sandwich a positive or negative electrical charge.</p>

        <h3>Charge controller</h3>
        <p>A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array.  It ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day, and that the power doesn’t run backwards to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries. Some charge controllers are available with additional capabilities, like lighting and load control, but managing the power is its primary job.
        A solar charge controller is available in two different technologies, PWM and MPPT. How they perform in a system is very different from each other. An MPPT charge controller is more expensive than a PWM charge controller, and it is often worth it to pay the extra money.</p>

        <h3>Battery system</h3>
        <p>Home energy storage batteries have been on the market for many years with numerous varieties and sizes. Due to the rapid improvements in lithium technology, modern lithium battery systems quickly superseded traditional lead-acid batteries as manufacturers developed smart, modular systems to suit different energy storage applications.
        Unfortunately, the one-size-fits-all approach is often taken when it comes to sizing a battery which can lead to poor system performance. This is typically due to two main reasons; undersized batteries, which don't have the capacity to meet the demand, or oversized batteries, where the solar array doesn’t have sufficient power to charge the battery in winter.</p>

        <h3>DC power</h3>
        <p>A DC-connected energy storage system connects to the grid mains at the same place as the solar panels; this usually means that they share a ‘hybrid’ inverter. You can think of this as a ‘one box’ solution, because there is only one inverter instead of two.
        Because they contain fewer components (which usually translates into lower costs), we generally recommend DC-coupled systems for homes considering a brand new solar & storage system (as opposed to a retrofit). Having a single inverter also allows households to get around local network capacity restrictions, which can be prohibitively small in some areas (most notably, South Australia, where the limit is 5kW for single phase grid connections).</p>

      <article class="A5">
        <h3>Inverter</h3>
        <p>The basic function of an inverter is to convert the direct current (DC) power that solar panels create to alternating current (AC) power that is usable in homes and businesses or fed directly into the grid.
        Inverters are responsible for continuously tracking the solar array’s voltage to identify the maximum power at which the modules can operate, according to PVEL. If shading occurs from environmental factors or if modules are degraded, the inverter can accidentally identify the wrong peak in the string, thus reducing the overall energy production of the system.
        Smart inverters, the new frontier of solar inverters, have advanced from one-way communication to two-way communication with the grid, assisting with grid-support functions. Thanks to advanced software, smart inverters can perform specific grid-supportive functionalities related to voltage, frequency, communications and controls.</p>

      <article class="A6">
        <h3>AC power</h3>
        <p>Alternating current describes the flow of charge that changes direction periodically. As a result, the voltage level also reverses along with the current. AC is used to deliver power to houses, office buildings, etc.
        An AC-coupled storage system is connected to the AC grid mains that service the property (that is, the lines coming in from the street).. You can think of this type of arrangement as a ‘two box’ solution – because there is one ‘box’ (inverter) for the solar panels, and another for the battery bank.
        The main advantage of AC-coupled battery storage is that it is the easiest and generally more cost-effective way to retrofit batteries onto a pre-existing solar PV system.</p>
