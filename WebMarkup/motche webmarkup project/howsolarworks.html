                Solar PV panels are comprised of many small photovoltaic cells – photovoltaic meaning they can convert sunlight into electricity. These cells are made of semi-conductive materials, most often silicon, a material that can conduct electricity while maintaining the electrical imbalance needed to create an electric field.This flow is known as an energy current, and the strength of the current determines how much electricity each cell can produce. Once the loose electrons hit metal plates, the current is then directed into wires, allowing the electrons to flow like they would in any other source of electric generation As the solar panel generates an electric current, the energy flows through a series of wires to an inverter.

                A charge controller is an essential part of nearly all power systems that charge batteries, whether the power source is PV, wind, hydro, fuel, or utility grid. Its purpose is to keep your batteries properly fed and safe for the long term.
    The basic functions of a controller are quite simple. Charge controllers block reverse current and prevent battery overcharge. Some controllers also prevent battery over discharge, protect from electrical overload, and/or display battery status and the flow of power. Let’s examine each function individually.

                A number of applications of battery energy storage in photovoltaic installations have been analyzed. The use of lead/acid batteries enhances the efficiency and reduces the cost. Some aspects of automatic charge/discharge control have been discussed. The rate of variation of the battery voltage can be used to determine the state-of-charge. This is based upon fundamental battery characteristics related to the kinetics of the lead/acid system. Although the cost of solar cells is still quite high, photovoltaic energy systems are competitive, not only in small remote installations, but also in large industrial applications.

                Direct current is defined by the constant flow of electrons  from an area of high electron density to an area of low electron density. In circuits involving batteries, this is illustrated by the constant flow of charge from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the battery. It is much more expensive and difficult to change the voltage of direct current as opposed to alternating current, making it a poor choice for the high voltage transmission of electricity. However, for very long distances, HVDC transmission can be more efficient than alternating current

                An inverter is an electric apparatus that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). It is not the same thing as an alternator, which converts mechanical energy (e.g. movement) into alternating current.
                Direct current is created by devices such as batteries and solar panels. When connected, an inverter allows these devices to provide electric power for small household devices. The inverter does this through a complex process of electrical adjustment. From this process, AC electric power is produced. This form of electricity can be used to power an electric light, a microwave oven, or some other electric machine.

                Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage.
